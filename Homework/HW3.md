Finish the process of three-way handshake, you can write the answer as:<br>
?1 = your answer<br>
?2 = your answer<br>
?3 = your answer<br>
?4 = your answer<br>

## Q3: (5 points)

+ A. IP
+ B. TCP
+ C. ARP
+ D. HTTP

## Q4: (5 points)

+ C. Default route
+ D. Best path


## Q5: (10 points)
When a router can’t determine a path to a message‘s destination, where does it send the message?
+ A. Default gateway
+ B. Routing table
+ C. Administrative distance
+ D. Gateway of last resort


## Q6: (10 points)
A routing protocol’s reliability and priority are rated by what measurement?
+ A. Routing table
+ B. MTU
+ C. Latency
+ D. AD


## Q7: (5 points)
Which routing protocol does an exterior router use to collect data to build its routing tables?
 + A. RIPv2
 + B. BGP
 + C. OSPF

## Q9: (30 points)
Use CISCO Packet Trace to construct the network in Q8, add the static routing entries to the routers, so that the communication between any two ports is available(I will use `ping` to randomly test 3 pairs of ports, 10 points for each pair ).

# Step 1: Save your answers for Q1-Q8 in a PDF file, name it as 'CSCI270_Homework3_JohnDoe(012345467).pdf' 
    (You can write down your answer in any text edit and print it as a pdf file later.)
# Step 2: create and save your cisco packet tracer project as 'CSCI270_Homework3_JohnDoe(012345467).pkt'

# Step 3: Zip the previous two files as one archive, name it as 'CSCI270_Homework3_JohnDoe(012345467)'

# Step 4: Submit your archive file on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.sau.edu)

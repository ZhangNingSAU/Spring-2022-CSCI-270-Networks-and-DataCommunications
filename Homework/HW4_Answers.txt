1. 
bandwidth: The amount of data that could theoretically be transmitted during a given period of time.
throughput/payload rate/effective data rate: The measure of how much data is actually transmitted during a given period of time.
The actual throughput is usually lower than the bandwidth.

1) noise
Two common sources of noise:
	EMI (electromagnetic interference): caused by electrical activity, such as RFI (radio frequency interference).
	crosstalk: Occurs when a signal traveling on one wire or cable infringes on the signal traveling over an adjacent wire or cable
2) attenuation
the loss of a signal’s strength as it travels away from its source.
3) latency
caused by the length of the cable, any intervening connectivity devices(such as routers)


3. 
full-duplex, also called duplex: Signals are free to travel in both directions over a medium simultaneously.


half-duplex-Signals may travel in both directions over a medium but in only one direction at a time.

simplex—Signals may travel in only one direction.

4. 
To carry multiple signals, the medium’s channel is logically separated into multiple smaller channels, or subchannels.

You can summarize the pros and cons for STP and UPT in the following differences
STP VS. UTP
1)throughput—STP and UTP can both transmit data at 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and 10 Gbps, depending on the grade of 
cabling and the transmission method in use.
2)cost—STP and UTP vary in cost, depending on the grade of copper used, the category rating, and any enhancements.
3)connector-STP and UTP use RJ-45 (registered jack 45) modular connectors and data jacks.
4)noise immunity—Because of its shielding, STP is more noise resistant than UTP. On the other hand, noise on UTP cable can be reduced 
with filtering and balancing techniques.
5)size and scalability—The maximum segment length for both STP and UTP is 100 m, or 328 feet, on Ethernet networks that support data rates
 from 1 Mbps to 10 Gbps.

PoE specifies a method for supplying electrical power over twisted-pair Ethernet connections

On an Ethernet network, carrying power over network connections can be useful for nodes that are located far from traditional power receptacles or need a constant, reliable power source.

Pros:
Extremely high throughput
Very high resistance to noise
Excellent security
Ability to carry signals for much longer distances before requiring repeaters
Cons:
The most significant drawback to fiber is that it is more expensive than twisted-pair cable.
Fiber-optic cable requires special equipment for splicing, or joining, which means that quickly repairing a fiber-optic cable in the field (given little time or resources) can be difficult.
